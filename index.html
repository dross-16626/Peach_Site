<p>Hello, my name is Timothei A. Peachtree, and I am an avid lover of the Prunus genus. For generations, my family have been growing and cultivating all kinds of fruit trees, and it is our ultimate goal to create a hybrid of the fruits in the prunus familly (excluding almonds) for the best tasting, ultra juicy "Apeachertarinum"!</p>

<h2>a little backstory of myself</h2>
<p>I am a botanist-turned-pomologist, which means I study and cultivate fruits. My colleague, Jamie Redwood, and I came up with the idea of creating a hybrid of every common fruit in the Prunus, just to see if it can be done. We were juniors in college, hung over and exausted from finals. He looked at me, and out of the blue, asked. "Do you think anyone has ever combined some plants in the same family togeter?" That sparked this absolutely mad science project, and I will always thank that man for it<br><br>Currently, we are still in our grafting stage, where we take cuttings off of specific trees just to see if they would work out. So far, weve only gotten a one successful hybird, and its parents are the Prunus domestica, the European plum, and Prunus serotina, commonly called black cherry. We have yet to discover the biochemistry and taaste of this newfound fruit, but we hope, with your continued support, that the fruits of our labor will be delicious<br><br>Hopefully, when we get a successful graft of our Apeachertarinum, we can get them on the market. for now, check out these provided sites to start your own!</p>
